                I am currently 20 years old on the dot. I like playing video games with my friends, watching anime, 
                and building model kits with my dad. Throughout most of my life, I lived in a small city called 
                Red Deer, Alberta, where I spent most of my eductation as well. When I was eighteen, I attempted a program 
                at the local post-secondary institution, the accuratly named Red Deer College. However, a <em>rough</em> year of studies made me come
                to the conclusion that I was not as invested in the field of the program as I would have to be to continue 
                into second year, so I chose not to continue and moved to Vancouver to live with my Dad so that I could recover from 
                tuition a little while I considered my other options. After an <strong>incredibly</strong> strange year, I decided to 
                enroll at BCIT's CIT program, and so here I am.
